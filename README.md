<h2>I am Certified Google Cybersecurity Professional by Coursera</h2>
<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª CyberSecurity Projects:</h2>

- <b>1. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) for a Small Business Network using Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys </b>

   - Set up a small network environment with various devices, including servers, workstations, and network appliances.
   - Use Nmap to conduct a comprehensive network scan to identify active hosts, open ports, and services running on the network.
   - Perform vulnerability scanning and assessment using Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys to identify potential security weaknesses and misconfigurations.
   - Exploit discovered vulnerabilities using ethical hacking techniques and tools, such as Metasploit or manual exploitation.
   - Document findings, prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity, and recommend remediation actions to enhance the network's security posture.

- <b>2. Web Application Security Assessment with DVWA and Burp Suite</b>

  - Install Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) on a local or remote server to simulate a vulnerable web application environment.
   - Use Burp Suite to intercept and analyze HTTP requests and responses, identify potential security flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references.
   - Conduct manual and automated security testing of the DVWA instance, including spidering, parameter manipulation, and fuzzing, to uncover vulnerabilities.
   - Exploit discovered vulnerabilities to demonstrate their impact and potential risks to the application and its users.
   - Provide recommendations for securing the web application, such as input validation, output encoding, and secure session management.

- <b>3. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Configuration and Testing with Snort</b>
   
   - Set up an IDS using Snort on a dedicated server or virtual machine.
   - Configure Snort rules to detect and alert on suspicious network traffic, such as port scans, malware activity, and known attack patterns.
   - Deploy Snort sensors in different network segments to monitor inbound and outbound traffic effectively.
   - Generate and inject test traffic into the network to trigger Snort alerts and verify the effectiveness of the IDS configuration.
   - Fine-tune Snort rules and policies based on observed network traffic patterns and false positive/negative rates to optimize detection accuracy.

- <b>4. Network Security Assessment and Hardening using tools Like Nessus, Nmap, Qualys.</b>

   - Perform a comprehensive security assessment of a corporate network infrastructure using a combination of Nmap, Nessus, and Qualys.
   - Identify weaknesses in network perimeter defenses, such as firewall misconfigurations, open ports, and exposed services.
   - Conduct authenticated scans to assess the security posture of internal servers, workstations, and databases.
   - Review and analyze scan results to prioritize vulnerabilities based on their impact and exploitability.
   - Develop and implement security recommendations and best practices for network hardening, such as applying patches, disabling unnecessary services, and implementing access controls.
